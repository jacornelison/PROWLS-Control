Scripts for automation and PROWLS data collection

Hi! If you're looking for PROWLS scripts and data you're in the right place! If not, too bad. That's all that's here.

In this repository you'll find:

Data - Logs, plots, and tables from various PROWLS characterization tests

Documentation - Helpful resoruces for coding the DLC Smart and SR830

Pretty Plots - Plots that are publication ready, what I used for the images on my poster and in my paper

Scripts - Scripts for taking data from PROWLS (Multi Frequency Scan and Set Frequency Scan), scripts for starting up and shutting down PROWLS, and scripts for analyzing data already taken from PROWLS (everything else)

To connect to the SR830 lock-in amplifier you will need the drivers here: https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html#544048
